### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Hi! I'm Ania
#### I'm a junior front-end dev who loves turning ideas into clean, smooth, and user-friendly interfaces

I love turning ideas into clean, responsive interfaces that feel great to use. With an eye for detail and a focus on usability, I make sure every line of code adds to the experience. I'm always exploring new tools, trends, and ways to level up my skills and solve problems smarter.

Right now, I'm working with **JavaScript**, **React**, and **TypeScript**â€”but I'm always up for diving into new front-end tools and leveling up my skills.
